# Final Project - Name Card Website Template
We're going to be using one of the templates on HTML 5 Up to create a web-based name card. Like the old-school paper ones, but better.


1. Download html5up's "Identity" template from this lesson's resources (PS: you can also browse the live demo sites on https://html5up.net/ and use a different template like "Astral" or "Ethereal"...)

2. Create a new PyCharm project called name-card and create a new Flask Application from scratch.

3. Create the necessary folders and move the relevant files from the download in step1.

4. Get the website to work when you access the root route ("/")

5. Personalise the website, change the background image, change the text, change the links, make it your own.
